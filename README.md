## Ecommerce Revenue Leakage Analysis using Data Analytics & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing revenue leakage in e-commerce platforms using data analytics and machine learning techniques. Revenue leakage occurs when businesses lose potential income due to issues such as failed payments, cart abandonment, pricing errors, discounts misuse, and operational inefficiencies.

The analysis helps uncover hidden loss points in the customer journey and provides insights to improve revenue retention and operational performance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
E-commerce businesses often face revenue leakage because:

- Failed or incomplete transactions  
- High cart abandonment rates  
- Incorrect pricing or discount application  
- Inefficient order and payment processing  

Manual identification of these issues is complex and time-consuming for large-scale transactional data. This project aims to systematically detect revenue leakage patterns using data-driven approaches.

## 🧠 Solution Approach
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on transaction and customer data  
- Identified key leakage indicators such as abandoned carts and failed payments  
- Applied data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Used analytical techniques and machine learning models to detect leakage patterns  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Data Analytics & Machine Learning  

## 📂 Dataset
- E-commerce transaction data including orders, payments, and customer activity  
- Simulated or publicly available e-commerce datasets  

## ⚙️ Workflow
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Identification of revenue leakage scenarios  
- Feature engineering  
- Model building and evaluation  
- Business insight generation  

## 📈 Results
- Successfully identified major revenue leakage sources  
- Highlighted high-risk transactions and customer behaviors  
- Provided actionable insights to improve revenue recovery and efficiency  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time monitoring dashboards  
- Deploy the analysis as a web-based analytics tool  
- Extend the solution to multi-channel e-commerce platforms
